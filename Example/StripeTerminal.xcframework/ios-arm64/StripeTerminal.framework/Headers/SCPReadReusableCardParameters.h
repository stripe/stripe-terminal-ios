/**
 Parameters for reading a reusable card.

 **NOTE: Most integrations should not use `readReusableCard`.**

 You should create a `PaymentIntent` and use the associated `collectPaymentMethod`
 and `processPayment` methods if you are simply collecting a payment from
 a customer.

 You can use `-[SCPTerminal readReusableCard:delegate:completion:]` to read
 payment details and defer payment for later. The `SCPPaymentMethod` created by
 this method will have type `card`, suitable for use with online payments.

 Note that if you use this method to defer a payment, the transaction will
 *not* receive the beneficial rates and liability shift associated with card
 present transactions.
