    SCPCart contains information about what should display on the reader's cart.

    the contents of the cart on the reader's display.

    You can pass the same SCPCart to multiple calls of setReaderDisplay since the cart
    is not coupled to any specific call of setReaderDisplay.

    not reflective of what the customer is actually charged. You are
