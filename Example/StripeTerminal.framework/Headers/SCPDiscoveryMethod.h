     Bluetooth Proximity

     If your app will be used in a busy environment with multiple iOS
     devices pairing to multiple available readers at the same time, we
     recommend using this discovery method.

     After a reader has been discovered using this method, the LEDs located
     above the reader's power button will start flashing multiple colors.
     After discovering the reader, your app should prompt the user to confirm
     that the reader is flashing, and require a user action (e.g. tapping a
     button) to connect to the reader.

     When discovering a reader using this method, the `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders`
     delegate method will be called twice. It will be called for the first time
     when the reader is initially discovered. The reader's LEDs will begin
     flashing. After a short delay, `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders` will be called
     a second time with an updated reader object, populated with additional
     info about the device, like its battery level.

     Internet

     When discovering a reader with this method `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders`
     will only be called once with a list of readers from `/v1/termina/readers`.
     Note that this will include readers that are both online and offline. This
     discovery method can only be used with the VerifoneP400 reader.

     Because the discovery process continues if connecting to a discovered
     reader fails, the SDK will refresh the list of `SCPReader`s and call
     `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders` with the results. For more details about failed
     connect calls, see `-[SCPTerminal connectReader:connectionConfig:completion:]`
