 The reader disconnected unexpectedly (that is, without your app explicitly

 In your implementation of this method, you should notify your user that
 the reader disconnected. You may also want to call `discoverReaders` to begin
 scanning for readers. Your app can attempt to automatically reconnect to the
 disconnected reader, or display UI for your user to re-connect to a reader.

 You can trigger this call in your app by powering off the connected reader.
