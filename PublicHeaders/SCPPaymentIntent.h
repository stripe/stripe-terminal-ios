 A PaymentIntent tracks the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
 We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
 customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
 see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

 A PaymentIntent transitions through multiple statuses throughout its lifetime
 and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.
