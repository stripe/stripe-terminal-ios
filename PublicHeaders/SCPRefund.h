/**
 An object representing a Stripe refund.

 Some payment methods, like Interac Debit payments, require that in-person payments
 also be refunded while the cardholder is present. The cardholder must present
 the Interac card to the card reader; these payments cannot be refunded via the
 dashboard or the API.

 @see https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/canada#interac-refunds

 The `collectRefundPaymentMethod:completion` and `processRefund` SDK methods
 allow you to build an in-person refund interface into your app.

 The refund SDK methods and the `SCPRefund` class are only available for
 payment methods that require in-person refunds, such as Interac Debit. For
 all other refunds, use the Stripe Dashboard or the Stripe API.
