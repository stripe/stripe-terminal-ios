 A Location is used to group readers in the Stripe Terminal ecosystem. The
 Location to which a reader is registered can control regional behavior
 for that particular reader.

 You cannot create locations through the SDK. Instead, use the Stripe API
 from your backend to manage your account's locations.

 To fetch the Location objects associated with your account, call
 `Terminal.shared.listLocations()`.
