/**
 The `SCPTerminal` singleton object exposes an interface for discovering readers,
 connecting to a reader, creating payments, and saving card information for later
 use.

 Before accessing the singleton object using the `shared` property, you must set
 a ConnectionToken provider: an object that implements the `SCPConnectionTokenProvider`
 protocol. This object should authenticate with your backend, then fetch the [secret](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/connection_tokens/object#terminal_connection_token_object-secret)
 from a freshly minted [ConnectionToken](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/connection_tokens).

 The SCPTerminal singleton can only be connected to one reader at a time, and
 can only perform one operation at a time. As a general rule, make sure the
 completion handler of one operation has been called before calling another
 operation from within your app.

 The Stripe Terminal SDK sends updates to your app by using the delegate pattern.
 You may want multiple views in your app to respond to these delegate calls.
 We recommend creating a central delegate announcer which broadcasts all delegate
 calls to views and ViewControllers that register themselves with that announcer.
 We have an example implementation of a TerminalDelegateAnnouncer as [part of our
 example application](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios/blob/master/Example/Example/TerminalDelegateAnnouncer.swift).

 Alternatively, you can wrap your call to `setTokenProvider:` with a
 `dispatch_once` in Objective-C, or use a static constructor in Swift.

 Note that you may only set a token provider *before* requesting the shared
 Terminal instance for the first time. In order to switch accounts in your app,
 e.g. to switch between live and test Stripe API keys on your backend, refer
 to the documentation for the `clearCachedCredentials` method on the shared

 - call `clearCachedCredentials`
 - call `discoverReaders` and `connectReader` to connect to a reader. The `connect` call
 will request a new connection token from your backend server via the token provider.

 An overview of the lifecycle of a connection token under the hood:
 - When the Terminal singleton is initialized, the SDK attempts to proactively request
 a connection token from your backend server.
 - When `connect` is called, the SDK uses the connection token and reader
 information to create a reader session.
 - Subsequent calls to `connect` will re-use the reader session if the SDK
 has successfully connected to the reader already. Otherwise, it will require a
 new connection token when you call `connect` again.

 Synchronous capture
 -------------------

 Stripe Terminal uses two-step card payments to prevent unintended and duplicate
 payments. When `processPayment` completes successfully, a charge has been
 authorized on the customer's card, but not yet been "captured". Your app must
 **synchronously notify your backend** to capture the PaymentIntent
 in order to settle the funds to your account.

 Handling failures
 -----------------

 When `processPayment` fails, the SDK returns an error that includes the
 updated `SCPPaymentIntent`. Your app should inspect the updated PaymentIntent
 to decide how to retry the payment.

 1. If the updated PaymentIntent is `nil`, the request to Stripe's servers timed
 out and the PaymentIntent's status is unknown. We recommend that you retry
 `processPayment` with the original PaymentIntent. If you instead choose to
 abandon the original PaymentIntent and create a new one, **do not capture**
 the original PaymentIntent. If you do, you might charge your customer twice.

 2. If the updated PaymentIntent's status is still `.requiresConfirmation` (e.g.,
 the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet), you
 can call `processPayment` again with the updated PaymentIntent to retry
 the request.

 3. If the updated PaymentIntent's status changes to `.requiresPaymentMethod` (e.g., the
 request failed because the card was declined), call `collectPaymentMethod` with the
 updated PaymentIntent to try charging another card.

 hash with relevant information, but in order for it to do so, you must specify

 information in this method's second parameter.

/**
 Confirms a SetupIntent after the payment method has been successfully collected.

 Handling failures
 -----------------

 When `confirmSetupIntent` fails, the SDK returns an error that includes the
 updated `SCPSetupIntent`. Your app should inspect the updated SetupIntent
 to decide how to proceed.

 1. If the updated SetupIntent is `nil`, the request to Stripe's servers timed
 out and the SetupIntent's status is unknown. We recommend that you retry
 `confirmSetupIntent` with the original SetupIntent.

 2. If the updated SetupIntent's status is still `.requiresConfirmation` (e.g.,
 the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet), you
 can call `confirmSetupIntent` again with the updated SetupIntent to retry
 the request.

 3. If the updated SetupIntent's status is `.requiresAction`, there might be
 authentication the cardholder must perform offline before the saved
 PaymentMethod can be used.

#pragma mark Card-present refunds

/**
 Initiates an in-person refund with a given set of `SCPRefundParameters` by
 collecting the payment method that is to be refunded.

 Some payment methods, like Interac Debit payments, require that in-person payments
 also be refunded while the cardholder is present. The cardholder must present
 the Interac card to the card reader; these payments cannot be refunded via the
 dashboard or the API.

 For payment methods that don't require the cardholder be present, see
 https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/payments/refunds

 This method, along with `processRefund`, allow you to design an in-person refund
 flow into your app.

 If collecting a payment method fails, the completion block will be called with
 an error. After resolving the error, you may call `collectRefundPaymentMethod`
 again to either try the same card again, or try a different card.

 If collecting a payment method succeeds, the completion block will be called
 with an `nil` error. At that point, you can call `processRefund` to finish
 refunding the payment method.

 Calling any other SDK methods between `collectRefundPaymentMethod` and
 `processRefund` will result in undefined behavior.

 Note that if `collectRefundPaymentMethod` is canceled, the completion block
 will be called with a `Canceled` error.

 @see https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/canada#interac-refunds

 @param refundParams  The SCPRefundParameters object that describes how the
 refund will be created.
 @param completion  The completion block called when the command completes.

/**
 Processes an in-person refund after the refund payment method has been collected.

 The completion block will either be called with the successful `SCPRefund` or
 with an `SCPProcessRefundError`.

 When `processRefund` fails, the SDK returns an error that either includes the
 failed `SCPRefund` or the `SCPRefundParameters` that led to a failure.
 Your app should inspect the `SCPProcessRefundError` to decide how to proceed.

 1. If the refund property is `nil`, the request to Stripe's servers timed
 out and the refund's status is unknown. We recommend that you retry
 `processRefund` with the original `SCPRefundParameters`.

 2. If the `SCPProcessRefundError` has a `failure_reason`, the refund was declined.
 We recommend that you take action based on the decline code you received.

 @note `collectRefundPaymentMethod:completion` and `processRefund` are only
 available for payment methods that require in-person refunds. For all other
 refunds, use the Stripe Dashboard or the Stripe API.
