 The `tokenProvider` is implemented by your code, and you can do this however you want.

 An overview of the lifecycle of a connection token under the hood:
 - When the Terminal singleton is initialized, the SDK attempts to proactively request
 a connection token from your backend server.
 - When `connect` is called, the SDK uses the connection token and reader
 information to create a reader session.
 - Subsequent calls to `connect` will re-use the reader session if the SDK
 has successfully connected to the reader already. Otherwise, it will require a
 new connection token when you call `connect` again.

/**
 Processes a payment after collecting a payment method succeeds.

 Synchronous capture
 -------------------

 Stripe Terminal uses two-step card payments to prevent unintended and duplicate
 payments. When `processPayment` completes successfully, a charge has been
 authorized on the customer's card, but not yet been "captured". Your app must
 **synchronously notify your backend** to capture the PaymentIntent
 in order to settle the funds to your account.

 Handling failures
 -----------------

 When `processPayment` fails, the SDK returns an error that includes the
 updated `SCPPaymentIntent`. Your app should inspect the updated PaymentIntent
 to decide how to retry the payment.

 1. If the updated PaymentIntent is `nil`, the request to Stripe's servers timed
 out and the PaymentIntent's status is unknown. We recommend that you retry
 `processPayment` with the original PaymentIntent. If you instead choose to
 abandon the original PaymentIntent and create a new one, **do not capture**
 the original PaymentIntent. If you do, you might charge your customer twice.

 2. If the updated PaymentIntent's status is still `.requiresConfirmation` (e.g.,
 the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet), you
 can call `processPayment` again with the updated PaymentIntent to retry
 the request.

 3. If the updated PaymentIntent's status changes to `.requiresPaymentMethod` (e.g., the
 request failed because the card was declined), call `collectPaymentMethod` with the
 updated PaymentIntent to try charging another card.

/**
 Reads a card with the given parameters and returns a PaymentMethod.

 **NOTE: Most integrations should not use `readReusableCard`.**

 You should create a `SCPPaymentIntent` and use the associated `collectPaymentMethod`
 and `processPayment` methods if you are simply collecting a payment from
 a customer.

 You can use `readReusableCard` to read payment details and defer payment for later.
 The PaymentMethod created by this method will have type `card`, suitable for
 use with online payments.

 Note that if you use this method to defer a payment, the transaction will
 *not* receive the beneficial rates and liability shift associated with card
 present transactions.

 If reading a card fails, the completion block will be called with an error
 containing details about the failure. If reading a card succeeds, the
 completion block will be called with a `PaymentMethod`. You should send
 the ID of the payment method to your backend for further processing. For example,
 you can use the fingerprint to look up charges created using the same
 card.

 the Interac card to the card reader; these payments cannot be refunded via the
 dashboard or the API.
