 Connect to a reader over the provided external USB channel. Reuses the existing MobileReaderDelegate

 The completion will be called with the SCPReader that has been connected to, or error.

 The SDK performs all the same actions as connectReader:, including checking for and installing
 required updates.

 There is no need to call discoverReaders when using this channel.

 Once connected all interactions match the existing behavior for mobile readers.
